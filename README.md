# stravaProject

The test will interact with multiple Strava.com features:
- Profile Settings
- Adding Manual Activity
- Creating a Post
- Athlete Search
- Clubs Search

A user should be able to: 
- edit profile settings and the changes will persist once saved. 
- submit a manual activity entry.
- create and publish a post to their timeline.
- search for an athlete where all related names show up in the results.
- search for a club where all related names show up in the results.
